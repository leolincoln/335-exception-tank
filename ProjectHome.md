# Project: T.A.N.K #


## intro ##
> A game of Tanks is played in real time. Two players over a network connection, or one player against a
computer opponent, maneuver their tanks on the screen, firing missiles at each other while moving around
the screen. The game ends when one player's missile has struck the other tank, reducing its health to zero
and thereby destroying it.
## expectation ##
The Tanks project lends itself well to object-oriented design concepts. You are expected to follow all of
the object-oriented concepts and ideas we have covered this semesterâ€”you are expected to make use of
inheritance, polymorphism, and design patterns from class when they are appropriate.
